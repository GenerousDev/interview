Getting Started

This guide details how to set up the development environment for this React project.

Prerequisites

Node.js (version 14 or later): https://nodejs.org/en/download
Git version control (optional, but recommended): https://git-scm.com/downloads
Steps

Clone the Repository (if using Git)

Bash
git clone https://<your-repo-url>.git
Use code with caution.
Replace <your-repo-url> with the actual URL of your public Git repository.

Navigate to the Project Directory

Bash
cd technical
Use code with caution.
Install Dependencies

The project uses a combination of npm packages for development and production. To install them all, run:

Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
Important Note: If you encounter setup errors during installation, you might need to force a reinstall of dependencies to ensure everything resolves correctly:

Bash
npm install force
Use code with caution.
Start the Development Server

The project utilizes Vite for development. To launch the development server and see the application running in your browser, execute:

Bash
npm run dev
Use code with caution.
This will typically open your default browser at http://localhost:3000/ (the exact port may vary).

Development Scripts

The package.json file defines several scripts to streamline development tasks:

npm run dev: Starts the development server using Vite.
npm run build: Builds the project for production, typically involving TypeScript compilation and bundling (using commands like tsc and vite build).
npm run lint: Runs ESLint for code linting and style checks.
npm run preview: Starts a preview server using Vite (exact behavior might vary depending on project configuration).
Additional Notes

Consider creating a .env.local file at the project root to store environment variables (e.g., API keys) that should not be committed to version control. You can reference these variables in your code using libraries like dotenv.
For more advanced usage or customization, refer to the documentation for Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, and other technologies used in this project.
By following these steps, you should be able to set up the development environment for your React project and start coding!
